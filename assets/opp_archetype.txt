Conversely, we can look at what archetypes, when playing for the Pacers' opponent, tend to cause the Pacers the most trouble. Using our data (from nba_api, the 20245-25 Pacers' 109 regular season and post season games), we can see that the Pacers struggle the most when an opposing player fits Archetype 3 (20 pts, 8 ast). The win disparity of about negative 5.5% indicates that when the Pacers face a player like this, they'll surely have a worse chance of winning. One thing we noticed is that Archetype 3 actually appears for the Pacers the least out of the five archetypes, so it's possible that they struggle against a player of such kind since they wouldn't be practicing as much against such a player. It's also worth mentioning that a statline of 20-plus points and 8-plus assists is quite a good statline, so it makes sense those kinds of players could skew the data.
