By looking at the win percentages for the Pacers when they do or do not have each archetype, we can find what archetype seems to tip the scale in the Pacer's favor the most. From the data we collected, we can see that Archetype 4 (25 pts, 4 3PM) seems to boost the Pacers' win percentage the most, boasting a win rate about 2.4% higher than the baseline. Of course, this percentage isn't very large, so we don't think we can assuredly say that having a player of the fourth archetype would automatically make the team better. A reason I believe this is because the Pacers' best player (in my opinion), Tyrese Haliburton, fits best into player Archetype 3 (20+ pts, 8+ ast), which shows the worst win rate when on the Pacers' side. However, a player like Haliburton could also fit into Archetype 4, displaying again how the nature of basketball makes games hard or even impossible to predict.
