This project aims to organize statistics and features from the 2024-2025 Indiana Pacers' season and find what similarities exist between wins and losses for games played in that time frame. We'll want to pull basic statistics from each game, including all 82 regular season games and all 23 playoff games. The statistics we'll look at include who played in each game, how long they played in each game, and each player's individual stats (points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc.) for each game they played in. Using this data, we likely can organize players into certain 'types.' For instance, if there's a game where a player shoots 80\% from three, we could say that the pacers had a sharpshooter for that game, which would likely improve their chance of winning. Additionally, we'll take into account the makeup of whatever team the Pacers played against. For instance, it's possible that the Pacers had a much worse win percentage against teams with a sharpshooting big that could stretch the floor. Hopefully, by focusing on the five highest-minute players and organizing them into certain player archetypes, we can create a decently accurate model to predict the outcomes of pacers games based on the pregame starting five.
