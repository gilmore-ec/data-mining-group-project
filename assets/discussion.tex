\subsection{Pacers Archetypes}
By looking at the win percentages for the Pacers when they do or do not have each archetype, we can find what archetype seems to tip the scale in the Pacer's favor the most. From the data we collected, we can see that Archetype 4 (25 pts, 4 3PM) seems to boost the Pacers' win percentage the most, boasting a win rate about 2.4\% higher than the baseline. Of course, this percentage isn't very large, so we don't think we can assuredly say that having a player of the fourth archetype would automatically make the team better. A reason I believe this is because the Pacers' best player (in my opinion), Tyrese Haliburton, fits best into player Archetype 3 (20+ pts, 8+ ast), which shows the worst win rate when on the Pacers' side. However, a player like Haliburton could also fit into Archetype 4, displaying again how the nature of basketball makes games hard or even impossible to predict.

\subsection{Opponent Archetypes}
Conversely, we can look at what archetypes, when playing for the Pacers' opponent, tend to cause the Pacers the most trouble. Using our data (from nba\_api, the 20245-25 Pacers' 109 regular season and post season games), we can see that the Pacers struggle the most when an opposing player fits Archetype 3 (20 pts, 8 ast). The win disparity of about negative 5.5\% indicates that when the Pacers face a player like this, they'll surely have a worse chance of winning. One thing we noticed is that Archetype 3 actually appears for the Pacers the least out of the five archetypes, so it's possible that they struggle against a player of such kind since they wouldn't be practicing as much against such a player. It's also worth mentioning that a statline of 20-plus points and 8-plus assists is quite a good statline, so it makes sense those kinds of players could skew the data.
