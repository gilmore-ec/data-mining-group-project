Professional basketball has entered an era where data driven decision making shapes everything from game strategies to team roster construction. The NBA's statistical tracking system captures hundreds of metrics per game. In return, this creates many datasets that offer great opportunities for analytical exploration. Predicting the outcome of NBA games is not an easy task. This is because every NBA game has great variability where a single shot or defensive stop could change the result of the game. For the Indiana Pacers, the leveraging of the vast amount of data collected by the NBA can prove to be very beneficial, providing a competitive advantage. The core problem this project aims to address is: Can we predict Indiana Pacers game outcomes more accurately by finding patterns in similar historical games?
